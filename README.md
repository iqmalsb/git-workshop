## Version Control & Git
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Preparation / Installation
To use git, you would have to install it on your local machine.

Go to [Git - Downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the instructions provided according to your machine's OS and architecture (x64 or x86).

Verify your installation by opening your terminal and running the command `git --version` (or `git -v` for short).

The following commands will be used primarily for your day-to-day use. There might be other commands that are not included in this README.
